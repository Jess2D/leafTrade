# Leaf Trade

![logo](https://github.com/Jess2D/theodinproject-restaurant-page/blob/master/img/Screenshot1.PNG)

## Purpose

C2C (consumer to consumer) platforms match buyers with sellers, this type of e-commerce is made up of online classifieds or forums where individuals can buy and sell their goods.

The intention of this project is to develop an MVP(minimum viable product) of a C2C platform for the client alongside an effective app design based on agile methodologies.

## The application

Leaf Trade is a full-stack MERN application. To achieve this solution we are working with React to implement the presentation layer, Express and Node to make up the middle or application layer, and MongoDB to create the database layer.

## Features

- Users are able to buy and sell their products
- The seller should be able to post a product with its associated details
- Sellers are able to create an item, view a list, view item details, update or edit the item and delete an item.
- Buyers should be able to view, leave comments and ask questions about the product/s.

## Usage

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the client directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
